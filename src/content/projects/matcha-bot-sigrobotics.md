🏆 **1st Place Winner** at the Embodied AI Hackathon!

Team SIGRobotics from UIUC developed an autonomous matcha-making robot as an MVP for a fully autonomous coffee shop concept.

### Hardware Stack

- **NVIDIA Jetson Thor** - Edge AI inference and processing
- **Modified XLeRobot** - Bimanual SO-101 arm system
- **3 USB 2.0 Cameras** - Multi-perspective vision data

### Software Stack

- **GR00T N1.5** - Vision Language Action Model for decision making
- **LeRobot** - Data collection and teleoperation framework
- **Custom bimanual control packages** - For dual-arm coordination

### Three Core Tasks

1. **Pouring matcha powder** - Precise powder dispensing
2. **Pouring water** - Controlled liquid handling
3. **Whisking** - Consistent mixing motion

### Key Innovations

- Custom LeRobot packages for bimanual SO-101 control
- Low-latency inference system with Jetson Thor as server
- Clever state encoding to handle model memory limitations
- Web interface prototype for voice-controlled operation
